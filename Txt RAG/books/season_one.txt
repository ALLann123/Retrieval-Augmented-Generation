Season 1

In the shadows of New York City, a brilliant but socially withdrawn cybersecurity engineer named Elliot Alderson lives a double life. By day, he protects networks at Allsafe Cybersecurity; by night, he’s a vigilante hacker exposing pedophiles, cheating spouses, and corporate corruption. Tormented by social anxiety, depression, and a morphine addiction, Elliot prefers code over conversation.

Everything changes when he meets a mysterious anarchist known only as Mr. Robot, who recruits him into an underground hacking collective called fsociety. Their mission: to bring down one of the world’s most powerful conglomerates—E Corp, which Elliot personally calls "Evil Corp." As fsociety’s plan—"Five/Nine"—unfolds, Elliot battles internal demons and external enemies.

But in the most shocking twist, Elliot learns that Mr. Robot isn’t real. He’s a figment of Elliot’s imagination—his mind’s projection of his dead father.

The revolution has begun. The world will never be the same.
