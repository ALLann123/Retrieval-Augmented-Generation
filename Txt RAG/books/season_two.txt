Season 2

The world is reeling. E Corp’s financial data has been erased. Banks crash. People panic. And Elliot? He’s hiding.

Haunted by the truth about Mr. Robot, Elliot isolates himself, living in strict routine with his mother in an attempt to "delete" Mr. Robot from his mind. But the ghost of his father keeps returning—taunting him, controlling him. The lines between delusion and reality blur even further.

Meanwhile, fsociety tries to keep the revolution alive, led now by Darlene, Elliot’s sister. But they’re out of their depth. The FBI closes in. A new player, Whiterose—a dangerous and enigmatic leader of the Dark Army—emerges from the shadows. Her interests in E Corp and time itself are sinister and vast.

Elliot slowly realizes that he’s missing time—whole chunks of memory gone. The truth is devastating: during his supposed isolation, he was actually in prison. His mind created an entire fake world to cope.

The revolution may have started, but Elliot's war with himself is just beginning.
